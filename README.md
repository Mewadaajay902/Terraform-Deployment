### Terraform Deployment with CI/CD

This repository demonstrates the deployment of infrastructure using **Terraform** integrated with **Azure Cloud Services** and **GitHub Actions** for a seamless CI/CD pipeline.

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to showcase the use of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles to automate the provisioning and management of cloud resources. By integrating Terraform with CI/CD pipelines, this project ensures reliable, repeatable, and efficient infrastructure deployment.

### Key Features

- **Terraform**: Automates the provisioning of infrastructure resources.
- **GitHub Actions**: Implements CI/CD workflows for testing and deploying Terraform configurations.
- **Azure Cloud Services**: Manages and hosts the deployed cloud resources.
- **Version Control**: Ensures all infrastructure changes are tracked and managed through Git.

### Project Workflow

1. **Write Terraform Configurations**: Define the infrastructure to be deployed.
2. **Version Control**: Push changes to this repository.
3. **GitHub Actions Pipeline**:
   - Validates Terraform configurations.
   - Applies the configuration to the target Azure Cloud environment using a secure workflow.
4. **Azure Cloud Services**: Hosts and manages the deployed resources.

### Prerequisites

- **Terraform CLI** installed locally.
- Access to an **Azure subscription**.
- GitHub account with repository access.

### How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mewadaajay902/Terraform-Deployment.git
   cd Terraform-Deployment
   ```

2. Configure Terraform variables:
   - Update `variables.tf` with your Azure environment details.
   - Ensure sensitive information is stored securely using environment secrets.

3. Commit and Push:
   - Make changes to your Terraform configuration.
   - Push them to start the CI/CD pipeline.

4. Monitor Deployment:
   - Check the GitHub Actions tab for pipeline logs.
   - Verify resources in your Azure subscription.

### Why This Project Matters

This repository highlights your capability to design and implement modern DevOps workflows with Terraform and Azure Cloud Services. It demonstrates expertise in IaC, cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelinesâ€”key skills for DevOps and cloud engineering roles.
